# Reflections

This project provided hands-on experience in translating MCP-inspired ideas into a functional agent system capable of integrating multiple map services. Designing the map servers as tools required careful definition of command schemas, argument structures, and output formats so the LLM could make correct tool selections. Working with real external APIs such as OpenStreetMap, Overpass, and OSRM reinforced how important reliable error handling and structured data are when building agent-driven applications. Integrating the Hugging Face LLM underscored that predictable, JSON-based responses greatly improve the agent’s composability and reduce unexpected behavior.

One of the main challenges was managing inconsistencies and edge cases across different map APIs—missing metadata, rate limits, or unexpected results. Creating robust wrapper functions around each map operation strengthened the reliability of the system and produced clearer, more user-friendly explanations. Overall, the project demonstrated how agent frameworks can unify multiple heterogeneous services under a single conversational interface. As a next step, I would expand the toolset with features like isochrone generation, elevation lookup, or tile-style customization, and explore how a fully MCP-compliant architecture could be deployed in production environments.
